# OpenAPI Diff Maven Plugin

This Maven plugin diffs OpenAPI v3 specifications to tell you what has changed.
It has an optional setting that allows you to raise an error when a change
has broken backward compatibility. OpenAPI v3 diffing is enabled by using the
[OpenAPI-diff](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-diff) project.
